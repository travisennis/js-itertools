# js-itertools

A JavaScript port of Python's itertools library that I undertook in order to better understand how to use generators. This primarily a personal project and not intended for serious use. There is really nothing this library does that isn't already accomplished by other, better-supported, libraries already available. Although, I will say I think this library is currently the only one to have ported `itertools.combinations_with_replacements`.

I have a few and notes references on JavaScript generators collected on my personal site at [https://travisennis/notes/javascript-generators](https://travisennis/notes/javascript-generators).
